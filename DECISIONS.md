# DECISIONS.md — Foundation Pass

Running log of assumptions and technical calls made autonomously under the Standing Orders
("decide and proceed"). Surfaced at the end of the pass instead of interrupting the build.
Newest at the bottom of each section.

## Posture (resolves the triage checkpoint)
- **D1 — Reshape-in-place, not greenfield.** Identity (`workspaces`/`memberships`/`profiles`) and
  the journey spine (`itineraries`/`stops`/`transitions`) exist and are tested; rebuilding from
  scratch would discard working engines and re-introduce fixed bugs. The genuinely-foundational
  work is (a) Work/Personal **Mode** + the privacy boundary, and (b) promoting **Intention/Gap/
  ResourceState** to first-class. Everything else is KEEP / REWIRE / STRIP per
  `docs/foundation-rebuild-triage.md`.
- **D2 — Keep Next.js App Router.** Standing Orders lock "React + TypeScript, standard router";
  the existing App Router satisfies this. Switching frameworks would be gratuitous churn.
- **D3 — Keep Supabase + anon-key/RLS client** (locked default). The privacy boundary is enforced
  in the data layer via RLS, exactly as the spec demands.
- **D4 — Fonts stay code-canonical** (Cormorant Garamond + Inter + Satoshi + JetBrains Mono). The
  Kickoff Brief's "Playfair Display, Lora" is superseded by the token manifest settled last pass.

## Data model
- **D5 — `mode` is a column, not a separate tenancy axis.** Added `app_mode` enum ('work'|'personal')
  to `itineraries`, `contacts`, `expense_records`, and new `tasks`. Personal-mode rows are visible
  to the owner only; work-mode rows to the owner + active workspace members. Backfilled
  `itineraries.mode` from `workspaces.type` ('organisation' → work).
- **D6 — RLS turned ON for the journey core.** `itineraries`/`stops`/`transitions` previously had
  NO row-level security (app-level scoping only — a latent breach risk the spec flags). This pass
  enables RLS with a `can_access_itinerary()` helper enforcing the §2 boundary. This is additive
  and owner-permissive, so it does not restrict any legitimate existing access.
- **D7 — Spec roles added additively.** `membership_role` gains `company_admin`/`team_manager`/
  `traveller` alongside legacy `owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer` (mapping: owner→company_admin,
  admin→team_manager, member/viewer→traveller). Legacy values retained to avoid breaking existing
  rows; the app reads via a mapping helper.
- **D8 — New first-class tables:** `intentions` (+`intention_anchors` link), `gaps`,
  `resource_states`, `tasks` — per handover §4.4/4.5/4.7/4.9.

## UI / structure
- **D9 — Contract component library lives in `src/components/concierge/`.** All 13 named placeholder
  components (ActiveTile, AnchorCard, IntentionCard, GapCard, LegCard, ComparisonMatrix,
  JourneyListCard, ModeSwitch, ContactChip, TaskRow, ExpenseRow, NudgeCard, ReadinessPrompt) built
  presentationally against decoupled view-models (`concierge/types.ts`), token-styled with the real
  class vocabulary (`j-card`, `h1/h2/h3`, `tag-ok/no/tight`, `btn-*`, `rounded-card/field/pill`).
  No emojis; Khonsera voice in copy. Design restyles by token, screens compose by name.
- **D10 — `/today` is the first new screen.** A day-of surface composing ActiveTile + AnchorCard from
  the user's nearest live journey's REAL stops — chosen as the end-to-end proof that the new RLS
  boundary returns the owner's data correctly in the running app (build + reads verified).
- **D11 — Existing screens kept running, not yet reshaped.** The legacy dashboard/itineraries/etc.
  still function under the new RLS (owner-permissive policies). Reshaping each remaining screen onto
  the contract components (Timeline, Comparison, Contacts, Tasks, Workspace/admin) is the next slice
  of Step 4 — sequenced per build-order, not done in one sweep, to avoid a half-migrated mess.

- **D12 — Active mode persisted in a cookie (`khonsera_mode`), switched via a server action.**
  `src/lib/mode.ts` (get/set) + `src/lib/actions/mode.ts` (`switchMode` → revalidate layout);
  `requireUserContext()` now exposes `activeMode`. `ModeSwitchControl` (client wrapper over the
  contract `ModeSwitch`) sits in the desktop sidebar + mobile topbar — reachable from every page.
  Cookie over a profile column = the simplest standard solution that survives refresh; cross-device
  persistence on the profile is a later enhancement. Mode-scoped reads wired on `/today`,
  `/itineraries`, and the Home dashboard; new itineraries are stamped with the active mode on create.
  This is layered ON TOP of the RLS boundary (RLS = security; mode filter = which lens you're in).

- **D13 — Tasks built end-to-end as the exemplar for a new entity.** `/tasks` (mode-scoped read) +
  `src/lib/actions/tasks.ts` (create/toggle/delete) + `TasksScreen` composing the `TaskRow` contract
  component. Chosen to prove the full new-table stack works: `tasks` table → RLS insert/update
  policies → mode scoping → contract component in a real CRUD loop. `/tasks` added to sidebar +
  mobile nav.
- **Note:** `docs/itinerary-pages.md` refresh for the new `/today` + `/tasks` screens and the
  mode-scoping of dashboard/itineraries is deferred to the screen-reshape slice (tracked here so it
  isn't lost), to avoid documenting surfaces that are about to be reshaped onto contract components.

## Done this pass vs remaining (against the Kickoff DoD)
- [x] Triage reviewed (checkpoint) · data model wired (Mode + privacy RLS + Journey/Anchor/Intention/
      Gap/Leg/ResourceState/Task + types) · `CLAUDE.md`/`DECISIONS.md` established · contract
      component library in place · one new screen (`/today`) navigable and wired · app builds + runs,
      181 tests green.
- [ ] Remaining for the full plateau: reshape the rest of the screen skeleton onto the contract
      components; persist mode in the app shell + wire `ModeSwitch`; the map is already integrated in
      the planning page (Step 5 salvage largely pre-satisfied — confirm tokens flow through).

## Deferred / blocking (needs an explicit nod — NOT done this pass)
- **B1 — Dropping the legacy CRM tables is the one irreversible step I will not take unsupervised.**
  `customers`, `customer_sites`, `visit_plans`, `visit_checklist_items`, `visit_status_edges`,
  `saved_trips`, `saved_trip_edges`, `travel_options`, `journey_legs`, `journey_leg_alternatives`,
  `planning_runs`, `trip_progress` and their routes/components are STRIP candidates (see triage),
  but they may hold real data. The code routes are removed (reversible via git); the **tables are
  left intact** until you confirm. No data lost.
